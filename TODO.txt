- check attr.types.txt file. might need a revision specific one! it is also outdated (from 667)
- fix recursive sort scripts return type detection. i manually fix these up right now, there are about 20 of them and remain as '??' UNKNOWN type
- replaced opcodes 47/48 with 49/50 for rev179, not sure what this change is about.
